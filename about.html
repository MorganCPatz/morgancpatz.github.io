## About
  
I'm Morgan Patzwald (@morgancpatz), a ConfigMgr and System Administator turned Security Analyst. 
I'm passionate about learning how to leverage both existing and new technologies to improve security. 
Another interest of mine is PowerShell and automation - although my skills can be described as novice at best. It's a work in progress. 
Some of my hobbies include gaming (PC/Xbox), skiing and snowboarding, biking, golfing, and enjoying the different seasons Michgan has to offer...Weather permitted of course.
