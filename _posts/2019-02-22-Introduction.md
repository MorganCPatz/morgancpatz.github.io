Hello - as the About section says, I am Morgan Patzwald (@morgancpatz).  Officially (by title) I've been working as an IT Security Analyst for the past 6 months or so.  Unofficially, it's been much longer than that.  Prior to moving into security, I was a ConfigMgr and System Administrator and this is where I would probably say my interest in security started.  

I mention and credit ConfigMgr as the starting point of my interest in security because of an early project I did relating to role based access.  We all know that Role Based Access Control is important - we hear about, we learn about it, we talk about it, but don't always seem to implement it.  To begin, I wanted to create a security role that allowed the Help Desk Team access to only sections they would use.  Namely, the "Assets and Compliance" section and "Monitoring."  Within each of these sections, I took it a step further and removed read access if it was an area they could not or did not need to use.  Long story short, this project was the first real instance where I wanted to make sure access was properly set and not just "close enough" or "good enough" but actually reflected only what was needed.

From that first project til now, it has ballooned into looking at security as a whole and seeing what areas I could improve upon.  In my own experience, regardless if its an environment with solo or multiple system administrators, security can be and unfortunately is at times, neglected.  I wanted to create this page to write about and document some of the changes I've made.  To some, a lot of these may seem simple or obvious and that's OK but to others it might not be; so hopefully it'll be helpful to those who need it.
