title: Separate Accounts for Admin Tasks

When my interest in security started to take off, suddenly everything look good and I wanted to dabble in so many different areas.  In the beginning, its often hard to decide where to start but even harder to stay focused once you started when there are so many changes waiting to be made.  This is where you should take a step back, survey the situation, and develop a plan.  The plan if you're not already there, should be about building a solid foundation so you can stack the layers.  Keep it simple and start small.   
 
For me, this would be looking at IT accounts and asking:
1. Are there shared admin credentials or does everyone (in IT) have their own account?
2. Are there separate accounts for admin tasks or are day to day accounts used for everything? 
3. Does everyone need the same permissions/privileges?  Does everyone need access to everything?
  
This post will focus on answering these questions by discussing the creation of Separate Accounts for Admin Tasks.  To begin, hopefully there is not a single admin account that is used for everything or is being shared.  Everyone in IT, who needs an Admin Account should have their own non-shared account that is also separate from their day-to-day account.  We want to create that separation of not only between individuals but between accounts as well.  Meaning, you should have at least two accounts: a Standard User account and an Administrator account.  

Typically not everyone will need the same permissions and privileges, nor will they need access to everything.  Environments vary for multiple reasons such as: department size, individual roles, culture, etc.  Creating that separation where possible and where it makes sense will help strengthen your security posture overall.  Does the Help Desk Team need the same access as the Server Team?  I'd certainly hope not.  So let's talk about account separation. 
  
I mentioned you should have at least two accounts - standard user account for day to day activities and an administrator account for admin related tasks.  This can be further divided up and additional accounts can be created for specific tasks, permissions, privileges, etc. but two is the absolute bare minimum.  Depending on your environment, this could result in each person in IT having 3, 4, or even 5+ accounts.  This largely depends on the roles within IT and the access needed.  Personally I like the idea of 4x different types of accounts: Standard User, Workstation Administrator, Administrator, and a Domain Admin Account. 
  
**Standard User Account**
* Account used for day-to-day activities, such as checking email, internet access, etc.
* This is a non-privileged account

**Workstation Administrator:**

* Used for administering workstations
* Has Local\Admin privileges on workstations
* Does **not** log into workstations - this is not a day-to-day account

**Administrator Account:** 

* Can be used for anything from Active Directory/Group Policy/Server Administration
* This account (obviously) has more permissions/privileges than standard user account
* Does **not** log into or administer workstations

**Domain Admin Account:** 

* Account used solely for Domain Administration - IE on Domain Controllers
* Used to add to Enterprise/Schema Admins as needed but removed from these groups when finished
* Does **not** log into or administer workstations and or servers.  Used only on DCs

Who gets what account depends largely on your environment, not everyone will need all 4x accounts.  Some will only need the standard user account and nothing else.  The point is, create separate accounts for separate tasks.  This helps to define roles, permissions, and privileges, and most importantly eliminates that single all powerful account.  If one of these accounts is compromised, then yes, bad things can still happen.  Regardless, care and effort should be taken to help secure these accounts. For example, this can be achieved by doing things such as:   
   
* Creating and Setting Fine Grained Password Policies 
* Setting User Rights Assignments > Deny Assignments to prevent certain accounts from certain actions 
* Utilizing the accounts only for their intended purposes 
* Enabling UAC on Workstations and Servers 
* Ensuring IT staff only have the accounts they need - Help Desk does not need an EA/DA Account.   
 
 
There are many things that can be done to help secure these accounts; the above is just a general idea of some steps that can be taken.  Separation of accounts and creating separate admin accounts for admin tasks is about using the right tools - the correct purpose built account, for the right situation.  EA/DA accounts should never touch the workstation, likewise a day to day to account should not have local admin privileges. Use of a single account or everyone having the same permissions and privileges should not exist anymore.

Creating separate accounts for admin tasks is an important layer that helps secure an environment.  Build the Foundation - Stack the Layers.  Defense in Depth.
